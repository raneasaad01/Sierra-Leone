1.3 The Open Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OSeMOSYS is an optimization software for long-term energy planning. It is an open source model structured in blocks of functionality that allows easy modifications to the code, providing a great flexibility for the creative process of the solution. The models that are built in OSeMOSYS minimize the total cost of the system for a certain period of time, defining the configuration of the supply system, considering some restrictions on activity, capacity, and emissions of technologies :cite:`HOWELLS20115850`. This is shown in the following equation: 

.. math::

   Minimize \sum_{y,t,r}Total\ discounted\ cost_{y,t,r},
   
where: *y* corresponds to the year, *t* to the technology and *r* to the region. 

The discounted cost can be expressed as follows: 

.. math::

   \forall _{y,t,r}\  Total\ discounted\ cost_{y,t,r}\  =   DOC_{y,t,r} + DCI_{y,t,r}  + DTEP_{y,t,r} - DSV_{y,t,r},
 
where: 

*	*DOC (Discounted Operational Cost):* Corresponds to the cost related to maintenance (fixed, usually associate to capacity) and operation of technologies (variable, linked to fuel uses and level of activity).  
*	*DCI (Discounted Capital Investment):* It is the cost of investment of all technologies selected to supply energy on the whole period. 
*	*DTEP (Discounted Technology Emission Penalty):* It is associated to the use of pollutants. The calculation is based on the emission factor and the activity of technologies and the specific cost by pollutant.    
*	*DSV (Discounted Salvage Value):* As the capital cost is discounted in the first year a technology is acquired, if in the last year of study the technologies have remaining years of operational life, the corresponding value is counted.
